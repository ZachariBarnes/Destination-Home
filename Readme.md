# Destination Home

This game was created as part of the 2019 Global Game Jam

You can find details about the game on the [Global Game jam website](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/destinationhome)

Unfortunately the download on the GGJ website is broken, but you can still download the final build from this repo and play it
Alternatively you can watch the Highlight video we made for this game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uxsl6-rIg0)

This is by far the best game submission I've been a part of to-date and I hope you like what you see.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions!
